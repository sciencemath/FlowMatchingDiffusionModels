    "The diffusion model works by starting with **real data**, adding noise to it, and then learning how to reverse that noise to get back to the original data. However, creating something **new**—such as generating images from text—happens during the **generation phase**, after the model has been trained.\n",

    "## **1. Training Phase (Learning How to Denoise)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **training process** for a diffusion model involves teaching it how to **reverse the noise** it has added to real data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- During training, the model is fed real data (e.g., images), and at each timestep, noise is gradually added to it (forward process). The model learns how to reverse this process (the reverse diffusion) so it can recover the clean data (original image) from noisy versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model **does not create new data** during training. It simply learns how to **denoise** noisy data by learning the relationship between noisy data and clean data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Generation Phase (Creating New Data)**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **From Text to Image (e.g., Text-to-Image Diffusion Models)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with Random Noise**: The model begins with a **random noise image**. This image is essentially a collection of random pixels with no meaningful structure or pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Text**: In a **text-to-image model**, the model receives a text description (e.g., \"A sunset over the mountains\"). This text description is used to guide the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conditioning the Model on Text**: The model is **conditioned on the text** using a mechanism like **CLIP** (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), or a similar architecture, to understand the semantic meaning of the text. This helps the model know what type of image it should generate from the noise, based on the input description.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gradual Denoising**: The model now **denoises the random image step-by-step**, guided by the textual description. At each step, the model makes the image less noisy and more structured, eventually generating an image that matches the description in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - At each timestep of the reverse process, the model **refines** the image by removing noise and introducing more structure according to what the text describes (e.g., \"sunset,\" \"mountains,\" \"sky\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **End Result**: After several steps of denoising, the random noise transforms into a **coherent image** that matches the text prompt. This is how the model creates a new image that it has never seen before!\n",

    "---\n",

During the reverse diffusion process, the model can apply that learned structure to **generate completely new data** from random noise, guided by the text or other inputs.\n",

    "### **What is Score Matching and Why is it Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Score Matching** is a method used to estimate the gradient of the log-likelihood of a probability distribution, also known as the \"score function.\" The score function provides the direction in which the likelihood of data is most sensitive to changes in the data. Estimating the score is crucial in machine learning and statistics, as it helps in understanding the data distribution and is used in generative models, such as in training energy-based models (EBMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Score Matching, the goal is to minimize the difference between the **true score function** and the **model's predicted score function**. This is done by training a model to match the gradient of the log-likelihood of the true distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Score Matching** objective is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{SM} = \\mathbb{E}_{p(x)} \\left[ \\| \\nabla_x \\log p(x) - s_{\\theta}(x) \\|^2 \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $p(x)$ is the true data distribution.\n",
    "- $s_{\\theta}(x)$ is the learned score function.\n",
    "- $\\nabla_x \\log p(x)$ is the true gradient of the log-likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "By minimizing this loss, the model learns to approximate the true score function, which is important for tasks like generative modeling and density estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is Score Matching Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Score matching is important because:\n",
    "1. **Gradient Estimation**: It provides a way to estimate the gradient of the log-likelihood without needing to explicitly compute the likelihood, which can be difficult in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "2. **Generative Modeling**: It is crucial in training energy-based models, where the goal is to generate data samples from a probability distribution without needing to normalize the distribution.\n",
    "3. **Improves Data Understanding**: By learning the score function, the model gains insight into the structure of the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Score Matching with Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider a simple univariate Gaussian distribution with a known true score function. Suppose the data is drawn from a normal distribution $N(0, 1)$ with a mean of 0 and variance of 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **True Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a univariate Gaussian distribution, the log-likelihood is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log p(x) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\log(2 \\pi) - \\frac{1}{2} x^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The true score function, which is the gradient of the log-likelihood, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla_x \\log p(x) = -x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the true score function for $p(x) \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model’s Score Function (Simplified Example)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s assume our model predicts the score function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_{\\theta}(x) = -\\theta x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is a parameter that the model learns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of score matching is to minimize the following loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{SM} = \\mathbb{E}_{p(x)} \\left[ \\| \\nabla_x \\log p(x) - s_{\\theta}(x) \\|^2 \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the true score is $\\nabla_x \\log p(x) = -x$, and the predicted score is $s_{\\theta}(x) = -\\theta x$. So, the loss function becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{SM} = \\mathbb{E}_{p(x)} \\left[ \\| x(1 - \\theta) \\|^2 \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{SM} = (1 - \\theta)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Minimizing the Loss**\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize this loss, we set the derivative with respect to $\\theta$ equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\mathcal{L}_{SM} = 2(1 - \\theta)(-1) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us $\\theta = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the optimal score function is obtained when $\\theta = 1$, which matches the true score function $\\nabla_x \\log p(x) = -x$.\n",
